A few minutes ago I released `@nut-tree/nut-js@2.3.0`! ðŸš€ 

This release only ships one change, but that is a **major UX improvement!**

Starting with release 2.3.0 macOS users will no longer have to fiddle with permissions themselves.

nut.js now **automatically checks and asks for required permissions!** ðŸŽ‰

Get it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nut-tree/nut-js)

[Check out the changelog](https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js/releases/tag/v2.3.0)

Please share your feedback on Twitter/GitHub/Discord!

All the best

Simon
