A few minutes ago I released `@nut-tree/nut-js@2.3.0`! ðŸš€ 

This release only ships one change, but that is a **major UX improvement!**

Starting with release 2.3.0 macOS users will no longer have to fiddle with permissions themselves.

nut.js now **automatically checks and asks for required permissions!** ðŸŽ‰

Please share your feedback on Twitter/GitHub/Discord!

All the best

Simon
