Huh? A dedicated nut.js page? Including a blog? Tell me more!

Well, it’s finally happening!
After more than two years of active development nut.js receives the home it deserves. 
It’s all rough an sketchy so far, but I recently thought about the progress I made with nut.js and decided to step things up a little bit.

I won’t go into much detail now, but rest assured that I have great plans for the future!

Feel free to look around, there’s not a lot to see thus far.
But also make sure to regularly check this page for updates!

All the best

Simon
