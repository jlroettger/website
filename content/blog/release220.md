A few minutes ago I release `@nut-tree/nut-js@2.2.0`! ðŸš€ 

This release comes with mostly bugfixes and some maintenance work, but there's **one** thing I want to highlight!

Starting with release 2.2.0 it's no longer a requirement to have [the Visual C++ runtime redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) installed.
For Windows users of nut.js this is quite a big deal, since it makes shipping solutions to other users and/or customers easier due to one runtime requirement less to take care off. ðŸ’ª

In the following days I'll also work on updating available plugins to support this as well!

Please share your feedback on Twitter/GitHub/Discord!

All the best

Simon
