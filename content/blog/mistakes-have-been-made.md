Sometimes we all have to admit that we made a mistake.
So do I.

A while ago I thought it would be super smart to configure an automation using GitHub actions to mark and auto-close stale issues.

In hindsight, I have to admit that this was a bad decision and I want to apologise.
Auto-closing issues might be a valid approach to tame the amount of open tickets if your organisation is flooded with issues where people are e.g. to lazy to go through documentation.

But this is not how nut.js issues work.
In most cases, every single issue opened is a valid bug report or feature request and I intend to work on these things when I find the time to do so.

Marking and auto-closing these issues didn't bring me any benefit.
Contrary, it annoyed the people who opened these issues and are watching them for progress.

To sum things up: I disabled the automation and re-opened all auto-closed issued.
I want to apologise once more in case you felt offended by this mechanism!

All the best

Simon
