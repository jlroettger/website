A few minutes ago I released `@nut-tree/nut-js@2.2.1`! ðŸš€ 

First and foremost, this release updated [jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) to its latest release to fix critical security vulnerabilities.

It also fixed a little bug on custom mouse movement where easing functions were not properly scaled.

Please report any issues on the [nut.js repo](https://github.com/nut-tree/nut.js)

All the best

Simon
